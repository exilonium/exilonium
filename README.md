## About Me

I write Python when I need things done and Rust when I want to feel smart. I spend more time on Monkeytype than actually typing code, watch anime while waiting for compilation, and read privacy policies for fun.

**Stack:** Python | Rust 🦀 | Bash | Sometimes Frontend | React | Tailwind | TS/JS | Html/CSS

## Projects I Made (~with claude~)

- [rizz](https://www.github.com/exilonium/rizz) - A simple interpreter written in rust for gen-z generation
- [RustShell](https://www.github.com/exilonium/RustShell) - A minimal Linux shell implementation using rust

## What I Do (pretend)

```rust
loop {
    match activity {
        Code => break_things_then_fix_them(),
        Break => watch_anime(jk_watch_primeagean),
        Warmup => monkeytype_for_three_hours(),
        _ => rice_arch_again(),
    }
}
```

## 🎯 Honest Skills

- Writing bugs at 67 WPM
- Fighting the borrow checker (losing record: 4-20)
- Breaking Arch and reinstalling it
- Commit messages: "fixed stuff", "updates", "nice"
- Pushing directly to main.
- Binge Mental Outlaw and Louis Rossmann instead of Theo.
